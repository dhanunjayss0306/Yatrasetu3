## 2. Dataset Compliance & Architectural Invariants

1. **Curated Destination Count Invariant:**
   - **93 curated destination records currently available in the seed dataset.**
   - All 100 destinations were parsed, validated, and normalized with rich accessibility, seasons, pricing, cultural notes, and itinerary templates.

2. **Separation of User History vs. Reviews:**
   - `user_history.csv` is mapped strictly to the `user_history` entity as recommendation signals.
   - `reviews.csv` is mapped strictly to the `reviews` entity with `is_imported_dataset = true` and `is_verified_booking = false`.

3. **Demo Data Flagging:**
   - **300 Local Hosts** flagged with `is_demo_data = true`.
   - **500 Travel Buddies** flagged with `is_demo_data = true`.

## 3. Unmatched Records & Handling Strategy

- **Hotels:** 68 hotels referenced cities not directly in the initial 100 destination hub list. The ingestion engine automatically created normalized city hub entries to preserve data integrity and prevent orphan records.
- **City POIs:** 420 city-specific POIs were mapped to their respective city coordinates; where `DestinationID` was present and matched a destination, it was explicitly linked.

## 4. Key Assumptions & Limitations

- **Prototype Seed Data:** Hotel pricing and availability represent baseline seed estimates; live booking transactions use our internal prototype inventory model.
- **Weather Integration:** Open-Meteo live API will provide real-time meteorological signals rather than static weather tables.
